# 🎮 Player Behavior Simulator (Inspired by The Sims)

This project simulates daily decision-making for a Sim-like character based on personality traits and current status (energy, social needs). It models player behavior using a decision tree classifier trained on synthetic gameplay data.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The simulator mimics how players might choose actions like work, rest, or socialize in life simulation games such as *The Sims*. It demonstrates agent-based modeling and decision logic in a game context.
